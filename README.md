## What is Octa?

**Octa Language** is an experimental programming language designed with clarity, composability, and minimalism at its core. It is built for developers who seek not only performance, but also expression — a language that helps you reason, not just instruct.

We believe programming languages are more than tools — they are a medium of thought. Octa is our response to the bloated, overly-complicated ecosystems of today. In the *Valley of the Octa Language*, we build from first principles, crafting a new stack shaped around human understanding.

## Key Principles

### ✅ Clarity Over Cleverness

Octa favors readability, simplicity, and maintainability over syntactic tricks or hidden behavior.

### ✅ Composition First

Instead of inventing complex meta-systems, we focus on small, composable building blocks. Whether it’s functions, types, or macros — they can be reasoned about and reused.

### ✅ Tooling is Part of the Language

Compilers, formatters, linters, REPLs — these aren’t accessories. In Octa, tools evolve alongside the language, designed for seamless integration and ergonomic workflows.

## Ecosystem and Projects

Within this valley, you’ll find not just a language — but an ecosystem.

- `octa` — The core language compiler
- `oflag` — A minimalist CLI flag parser
- `octa-docs` — Documentation and guides
- `octa-examples` — Practical usage and learning resources
- `octa-tools` — Developer tooling around Octa

## Who is this for?

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity in modern tooling...  
If you’ve longed for a language that lets you **think first**, and **code second**...  
If you believe in **small, sharp, extensible tools**...

Then you’re welcome in the Valley.
